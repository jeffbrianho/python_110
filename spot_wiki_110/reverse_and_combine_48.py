# Your task is to Reverse and Combine Words.
# Input: String containing different "words" separated by spaces
# 1. More than one word? Reverse each word and combine first with second, third with fourth and so on...
# (odd number of words => last one stays alone, but has to be reversed too)
# 2. Start it again until there's only one word without spaces
# 3. Return your resultâ€¦

"""
P:
I: String of words (sep by space)
O: string of word reversed
E: if more than 1 word, reverse each word and combine 1-2 3-4 4-5 6 until there is only 1 word.
word is char sep by space 
I: alphas and nums

E:  # 1 cbafed only 1x due to 2 letters
    # 2 iterated 2x due to 4 word   cbafed ihglkj 
                                    defabcjklghi

D: lists of separated word
list of combined words

A:
taking each word and reversing them, then combining in pairs
keep reversing and combining until only 1 word (while statement)

while statement len words > 1
break down sentence into individual list of words
reverse word and combine return to `new_list`
use length to combine only 1 and 2 3 and 4 if odd keep last same. consider slicing indexed words

return list as wordlist[0]

# Time to complete: 37:35 mins
# Theme: manipulate words and return new word in loop for conditional
# Approach: create while loop for condition, use a helper function for concrete actions
# iterate through indexs to work with word pairs.
